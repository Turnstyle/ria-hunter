## Backend Progress
| Task ID | Description | Assigned Agent | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Create and run migrations for missing tables | Backend | completed | Created ria_profiles, narratives, control_persons, and ria_private_funds tables with proper relationships. Added HNSW indexes for vector search and Row-Level Security policies. Using pgvector with 384-dimension embeddings. |
| B2 | Load sample data and run embedding script | Backend | completed | Created load_sample_data.py script that generates realistic RIA data with executives and funds. Script handles authentication and provides helpful console output. |
| B3 | Embedding generation | Backend | completed | Implemented embed_narratives_sample.py supporting three modes: mock (for testing), Vertex AI (textembedding-gecko@003), and OpenAI (text-embedding-3-small). Added batch processing with configurable sizes. |
| B4 | API design & implementation | Backend | completed | Implemented GET /api/v1/ria/query endpoint with support for semantic and hybrid search.
