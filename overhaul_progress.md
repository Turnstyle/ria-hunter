# RIA Hunter Overhaul Progress

## Backend Progress
| Task ID | Description | Assigned Agent | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------|-------|
| B1 | Create and run migrations for missing tables | Backend | done | Successfully applied the CIK column migration to the ria_profiles table. Added appropriate indexes and constraints for efficient lookups. |
| B2 | Data loading and narrative generation | Backend | in progress | Attempted to run load_and_embed_data.ts script. Initial data loading and narrative generation is ready, but encountered an issue with the Vertex AI embedding model integration. |
| B3 | Embedding generation | Backend | in progress | Encountered error with Vertex AI embedding model. Need to investigate and fix the API integration issue. |
| B4 | API design & implementation | Backend | done | Created /api/v1/ria/search endpoint with hybrid search support. Implemented hybrid_search_rias SQL function that combines vector similarity with text search for better results with proper names. API includes credit system integration and authentication. |
| B5 | Final backend deployment | Backend | in progress | Environment variables configured (AI_PROVIDER now correctly set to vertex per Vercel settings). Need to resolve embedding issues before final deployment. |

## Bugs & Issues Log
| ID | Component | Description | Severity | Status | Notes |
|----|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|-------|
| BUG-001 | API | API routes use mock data instead of real data | high | fixed | Implemented real data fetching in the backend with /api/v1/ria/search endpoint that connects to the Supabase database |
| BUG-002 | Search | Hybrid search toggle in UI needs backend implementation | medium | fixed | Implemented hybrid_search_rias function and integrated with the search API to support both vector similarity and text search |
| BUG-003 | Environment | Environment variables need consolidation | medium | fixed | Consolidated environment variables by moving contents from env.local to .env.local and setting AI_PROVIDER=vertex to match Vercel configuration |
| BUG-004 | Deployment | Final deployment verification needed | medium | open | Need to run scripts and verify deployment on Vercel to ensure everything works in production |
| BUG-005 | Embedding | Vertex AI embedding model integration error | high | open | Getting error "TypeError: this.embeddingModel.predict is not a function" when trying to generate embeddings. Need to investigate Vertex AI SDK compatibility. |
