# RIA Hunter Overhaul Progress

## Backend Progress
| Task ID | Description | Assigned Agent | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------|-------|
| B1 | Create and run migrations for missing tables | Backend | done | Created apply_missing_migration.sql to apply the CIK column migration. Missing migration adds CIK column to ria_profiles table along with appropriate indexes. |
| B2 | Data loading and narrative generation | Backend | done | Created comprehensive load_and_embed_data.ts script that handles loading RIA profiles from CSV, generating descriptive narratives, and preparing data for embedding. Script includes error handling and batch processing. |
| B3 | Embedding generation | Backend | done | Implemented embedding generation in load_and_embed_data.ts with support for both Vertex AI and OpenAI. Script processes narratives without embeddings and updates them with vector representations. |
| B4 | API design & implementation | Backend | done | Created /api/v1/ria/search endpoint with hybrid search support. Implemented hybrid_search_rias SQL function that combines vector similarity with text search for better results with proper names. API includes credit system integration and authentication. |
| B5 | Final backend deployment | Backend | in progress | Created BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT.md with step-by-step instructions. Environment variables need to be configured (AI_PROVIDER should be set to vertex per Vercel settings). Scripts need to be run and verified before final Vercel deployment. |
