# RIA Hunter Overhaul Status Update

## Current Status

We've made significant progress on the RIA Hunter overhaul plan. Here's a detailed status update focused on what has been completed and what remains to be done.

### Completed Work

**Frontend Tasks (F1-F7):**
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up the repository and removed Sentry integration
- ‚úÖ Implemented the RAG search UI with search input and results display
- ‚úÖ Added browse page improvements with filters and responsive design
- ‚úÖ Implemented credits, subscription, and settings functionality
- ‚úÖ Applied consistent styling and accessibility improvements
- ‚úÖ Deployed the frontend to Vercel

**Backend Tasks (B1-B4):**
- ‚úÖ Created scripts for database migrations, including adding the CIK column
- ‚úÖ Implemented data loading pipeline for RIA profiles
- ‚úÖ Created narrative generation functionality
- ‚úÖ Developed embedding generation using AI providers (OpenAI/Vertex)
- ‚úÖ Designed and implemented the search API endpoint
- ‚úÖ Added hybrid search functionality combining vector and text search
- ‚úÖ Integrated with the credit/subscription system

### Remaining Work

**Backend Tasks:**
- üîÑ **B5: Final backend deployment** - We've created detailed deployment instructions, but the actual deployment still needs to be executed

**Frontend Tasks:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è **F4: Analytics page** - This was deprioritized in favor of core functionality and remains unimplemented

### Open Issues

1. **Environment Variable Consolidation** - There are multiple environment files that need to be consolidated, particularly to ensure the AI_PROVIDER is set to "vertex" to match the Vercel configuration
2. **Final Deployment Verification** - Need to verify that the backend works correctly in production after deployment

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Copy the contents of `env.local` to `.env.local`
   - Update AI_PROVIDER to "vertex" in `.env.local`
   - Verify all environment variables are correctly set in Vercel

2. **Run Data Pipeline**:
   - Execute the data loading and embedding script
   - Verify data is properly loaded into the database
   - Apply the hybrid search SQL function

3. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Deploy the backend to Vercel using the CLI
   - Verify the API endpoints are working correctly
   - Test the search functionality with the hybrid search option

## Questions for Master AI Agent

1. **AI Provider Preference**: Should we continue using Vertex AI for embeddings or switch to OpenAI? Vertex AI offers cost advantages, but OpenAI might provide different quality embeddings.

2. **Data Refresh Strategy**: What's the recommended approach for updating embeddings when new RIA data is available? Should we implement a scheduled job or trigger manual updates?

3. **Performance Monitoring**: What metrics should we track to monitor the search quality and performance? Are there specific benchmarks we should aim for in terms of response time and result relevance?

4. **Hybrid Search Weighting**: The current implementation gives slightly lower weight to text matches compared to vector similarity (0.8 vs 1.0). Should we adjust this based on user feedback?

5. **Future Enhancements**: After completing the core functionality, which features should be prioritized next? Options include:
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Advanced filtering options
   - User feedback mechanism for search results
   - Batch embedding updates

## Conclusion

The RIA Hunter overhaul is nearly complete, with all core functionality implemented. The frontend is fully deployed, and the backend code is ready for deployment. The remaining work is primarily focused on environment configuration and final deployment steps.

Once deployed, the system will provide a powerful search experience for RIA data, combining the semantic understanding of vector search with the precision of text search.
