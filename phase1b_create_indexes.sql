-- Phase 1b: Create HNSW Indexes for Maximum Performance
-- ONLY run this AFTER the vector conversion is 100% complete
-- This will provide the 507x performance improvement from 1823ms to <10ms

-- Step 1: Verify conversion is complete first
SELECT

    COUNT(embedding_vector) as vector_embeddings,
    ROUND(COUNT(embedding_vector)::decimal / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as completion_percentage
FROM narratives
WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL;

-- If completion_percentage is not 100%, STOP and wait for conversion to finish

-- Step 2: Create HNSW index for ultra-fast cosine similarity search
-- This is the key to achieving <10ms query times
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS narratives_embedding_hnsw_cosine_idx 
ON narratives 
USING hnsw (embedding_vector vector_cosine_ops) 
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 200);

-- Step 3: Create supporting indexes for filtered searches
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS narratives_crd_embedding_idx
ON narratives (crd_number)
WHERE embedding_vector IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 4: Create GIN index for hybrid search (text + vector)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS narratives_fulltext_idx
ON narratives 
USING gin(to_tsvector('english', narrative))
WHERE embedding_vector IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 5: Create composite index for state-filtered searches
-- This enables the enhanced search_rias_vector function
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS ria_profiles_state_crd_idx
ON ria_profiles (state, crd_number)
WHERE state IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 6: Analyze tables for query planner optimization
ANALYZE narratives;
ANALYZE ria_profiles;
