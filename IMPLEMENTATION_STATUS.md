# RIA Hunter Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Enhanced Query Parsing**
   - Created `lib/states.ts` with comprehensive US state mappings
   - Created `lib/queryParser.ts` with intelligent query parsing that detects:
     - State names and abbreviations (e.g., "Missouri", "MO")
     - Superlatives (largest, smallest, top N)
     - Specific firm names
     - Investment focus terms
     - Count queries

2. **Updated /api/ask Endpoint**
   - Integrated enhanced query parsing
   - Improved search logic with proper state filtering
   - Enhanced prompt engineering for Vertex AI Gemini
   - Added specific instructions based on query type
   - Prepared for vector similarity search integration

3. **Vector Search Infrastructure**
   - Created SQL function `match_narratives` for vector similarity search
   - Prepared embedding generation scripts for Vertex AI
   - Set up proper 768-dimensional vectors for textembedding-gecko@003

## ðŸš§ In Progress

1. **Narrative Embeddings**
   - Need to run `scripts/setup_embeddings.sql` in Supabase SQL editor
   - Then run `scripts/embed_narratives_simple.ts` to generate embeddings
   - This will enable semantic search for investment focus queries

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migrations
Run the following SQL in Supabase SQL editor (https://app.supabase.com/project/llusjnpltqxhokycwzry/sql):
```sql
-- Copy contents of scripts/setup_embeddings.sql
```

### 2. Generate Embeddings
```bash
# Set environment variables
export SUPABASE_URL="https://llusjnpltqxhokycwzry.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"
export GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="ria-hunter-backend"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="./gcp-key.json"

# Run embedding generation (start with small batch)
npx tsx scripts/embed_narratives_simple.ts --limit=100

# Once verified working, run for all narratives
npx tsx scripts/embed_narratives_simple.ts --limit=30000
```

### 3. Test the Implementation
```bash
# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run tests
npx tsx scripts/test_api_endpoint.ts
```

### 4. Deploy to Production
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_B64` (base64 encoded GCP key)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (as fallback)

2. Deploy:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement enhanced RAG with Vertex AI for RIA queries"
git push origin main
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Behavior After Implementation

1. **"What is the largest RIA in Missouri?"**
   - Will correctly filter to only Missouri firms
   - Will return the single firm with highest AUM
   - Clear answer: "The largest RIA in Missouri is [Firm Name] with $X billion in assets under management."

2. **"Show me the top 5 RIAs in California"**
   - Will filter to California firms
   - Return exactly 5 firms ordered by AUM

3. **"Which RIAs specialize in sustainable investing?"**
   - Once embeddings are loaded, will search narrative content
   - Return firms whose descriptions mention ESG/sustainable investing

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If Vertex AI is not working:
1. Check GCP credentials: `ls -la gcp-key.json`
2. Verify project ID is correct
3. Ensure Vertex AI API is enabled in GCP console
4. Check logs for specific error messages

### If embeddings fail:
1. Verify the narratives table has data
2. Check that the embedding column exists with correct dimensions (768)
3. Monitor rate limits - the script includes delays
4. Start with small batches to test

### If queries return wrong results:
1. Check that state parsing is working correctly
2. Verify the database has the expected data
3. Look at the generated SQL queries in logs
4. Test the prompt directly with sample data
