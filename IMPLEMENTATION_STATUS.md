# RIA Hunter Vector Migration Implementation Status

## Phase 1 Implementation Summary (Completed)

### Vector Migration Success
- ✅ **Converted 41,303 narratives** from JSON string embeddings to native PostgreSQL vector(768) format
- ✅ **Created vector search functions**:
  - `match_narratives`: For direct vector similarity searches
  - `search_rias_vector`: For enhanced searches with company information

### Technical Details
- Used correct **768-dimensional vectors** (not 384 as originally thought)
- Successfully performed the conversion in batches through the Supabase SQL Editor
- Created SQL functions utilizing PostgreSQL's vector operators (<=> for cosine similarity)

### Remaining Items
- **HNSW Index Creation**: This will need to be done through direct database access or management tools, as it exceeded the SQL Editor limits. This index will enable the target 507x performance improvement.
- **IVFFlat Indexes**: Additional supporting indexes for filtered searches also need to be created through admin tools.

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: ETL Pipeline (Pending)
- Processing the ~62,317 missing narratives 
- Processing missing private funds data (99.99% unprocessed)
- Processing missing control persons data (99.56% unprocessed)

### Phase 3-7 (Pending)
- API standardization
- Infrastructure and monitoring
- Scheduled jobs and automation
- Security and compliance
- Performance testing and validation

## Implementation Notes

### Issues Encountered
- The SQL Editor in Supabase has transaction timeout limitations for long-running operations
- HNSW index creation for large vector data requires direct database access
- Standard B-tree indexes have size limitations (2704 bytes) that prevent direct indexing of 768-dimensional vectors (3088 bytes)

### Performance Expectations
Once the HNSW index is created, vector search performance should improve from ~1800ms to <10ms per query, achieving the target 507x performance improvement specified in the refactor plan.

### Migration Approach Used
- Converted string embeddings to vectors using a custom SQL function
- Processed in small batches (5,000 records at a time) to avoid timeouts
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API functions
