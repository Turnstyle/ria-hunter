Fix backend API reliability for production

CRITICAL FIXES:
1. Credits/Balance API (/\_backend/api/balance):
   - Now allows anonymous users (no 401 errors)
   - Returns 15 credits for guests with stable guest_id cookie
   - Properly returns isSubscriber flag for all users
   - Added Cache-Control: no-store headers

2. Stripe Webhook (/\_backend/api/stripe-webhook):
   - Added GET health check endpoint (?ping=1)
   - Enhanced idempotency and debug logging
   - Properly handles subscription status updates
   - Returns 200 on all webhook events to prevent retries

3. Chat Streaming (/api/ask-stream):
   - Guarantees stream completion with [DONE] marker
   - Provides friendly fallback when LLM unavailable
   - Properly formats SSE tokens with JSON escaping
   - Always closes stream cleanly

4. Testing & Monitoring:
   - Added unit tests for credits system
   - Added SSE formatting tests
   - Created smoke test script for production validation
   - Added npm run smoke command

All changes ensure production endpoints work reliably for both
anonymous and authenticated users per requirements.
