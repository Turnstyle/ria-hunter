# RIA Hunter Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview

The RIA Hunter backend has been successfully implemented according to the overhaul plan. We've created all necessary database tables, implemented data loading and embedding generation scripts, and developed API endpoints for the RAG search functionality.

## Completed Tasks

### B1 - Database Schema and Migrations

- Created SQL migration to add missing CIK column to the `ria_profiles` table
- Verified all existing migrations were properly applied
- Created indexes to optimize query performance

### B2 - Data Loading and Narrative Generation

- Implemented `load_and_embed_data.ts` script that:
  - Loads RIA profiles from CSV files
  - Inserts/updates profiles in the database
  - Generates descriptive narratives for each profile
  - Handles batch processing for performance

### B3 - Embedding Generation

- Integrated embedding generation into the data pipeline
- Supports both Vertex AI and OpenAI embeddings
- Implemented batch processing with error handling
- Configured for 384-dimensional embeddings (Vertex AI's textembedding-gecko@003)

### B4 - API Design & Implementation

- Created a new `/api/v1/ria/search` endpoint that:
  - Accepts natural language queries
  - Supports state filtering and other parameters
  - Performs vector similarity search
  - Implements hybrid search combining vector and text search
  - Handles user authentication and query limits
  - Returns formatted results with executive information

- Implemented hybrid search functionality by:
  - Creating a `hybrid_search_rias` SQL function
  - Combining vector similarity with text search
  - Using reciprocal rank fusion to blend results
  - Optimizing database indexes for performance

## Key Features

### Vector Similarity Search

The system uses pgvector's cosine similarity to find semantically similar content. The database has been configured with HNSW indexes for fast approximate nearest-neighbor search, allowing efficient querying of high-dimensional vector data.

### Hybrid Search

The hybrid search implementation combines:
- **Vector similarity**: Captures semantic meaning of queries
- **Text search**: Improves exact matches for names and specific terms
- **Result fusion**: Blends both approaches for optimal results

### Credit System

The API integrates with the credit system to:
- Track user queries
- Enforce free-tier limits
- Support anonymous usage with cookie tracking
- Check subscription status

### Data Enrichment

Query results are enriched with:
- Executive information from the `control_persons` table
- Private fund details when available
- Properly formatted narratives for context

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the future:

1. **Batch embedding updates**: Implement a scheduled job to re-embed content as the model improves
2. **Custom ranking**: Allow users to customize how results are ranked
3. **Result clustering**: Group similar RIAs together in results
4. **Analytics integration**: Track popular searches and improve results based on user behavior

## Deployment

See `BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed deployment instructions. The backend should be deployed to Vercel with all necessary environment variables configured.

## Integration with Frontend

The frontend team has already implemented the UI for search functionality. The backend API endpoints have been designed to match the frontend's expectations, requiring no changes to the frontend code. The hybrid search toggle in the UI now has a corresponding backend implementation.

## Conclusion

The RIA Hunter backend implementation provides a robust foundation for semantic search of RIA data. The system can efficiently answer natural language queries about investment advisers, their activities, and their executives, with a focus on venture capital activity.
