# üî¥ BACKEND AGENT TASKS (ria-hunter repo)

**Priority: CRITICAL \- Must complete first**

## Task 1: Add Rewrite Rules to Fix Routing (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**File:** `next.config.mjs`

Add this rewrites section to your next.config:

const nextConfig \= {

  async rewrites() {

    return \[

      // Critical mappings to fix frontend/backend mismatch

      {

        source: '/api/credits/balance',

        destination: '/\_backend/api/balance'

      },

      {

        source: '/api/balance',  

        destination: '/\_backend/api/balance'

      },

      {

        source: '/api/ask-stream',

        destination: '/\_backend/api/ask-stream'

      },

      {

        source: '/api/ask',

        destination: '/\_backend/api/ask'

      }

    \]

  },

  // ... rest of your config

}

## Task 2: Update Middleware Skip Paths

**File:** `middleware.ts`

Update the `skipAuthPaths` array to include:

const skipAuthPaths \= \[

  '/api/stripe-webhook',

  '/api/test-env',

  '/api/ria-hunter-waitlist',

  '/api/save-form-data',

  '/api/v1/ria/',

  '/api/ria/',

  '/api/ask',

  '/api/ask-stream',

  '/api/balance',

  '/api/credits/balance',  // Add this

  '/api/\_backend/api/balance',  // Add this

  '/api/\_backend/api/credits/balance',  // Add this

  '/api/debug/'

\]

## Task 3: Remove or Fix Broken Legacy Routes

**Files to check:**

- `/app/api/balance/route.ts` (if exists \- DELETE or fix the 500 error)  
- `/app/api/credits/balance/route.ts` (if exists \- DELETE or fix the 500 error)

These are causing 500 errors. Either:

1. DELETE them (recommended) since `/_backend/api/balance` works perfectly  
2. OR fix them to re-export from the working `/_backend` versions

## Task 4: Deploy and Test

1. Commit all changes  
2. Push to GitHub  
3. Wait for Vercel deployment  
4. Test these endpoints:  
   - `curl https://ria-hunter.app/api/balance` ‚Üí Should return `{"balance":15}`  
   - `curl https://ria-hunter.app/api/credits/balance` ‚Üí Should return `{"credits":15,"isSubscriber":false}`  
   - `curl -X POST https://ria-hunter.app/api/ask-stream -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"test"}'` ‚Üí Should stream response

## üö® HUMAN INTERVENTION POINT üö®

IF THE ABOVE TESTS FAIL:

1\. Check Vercel deployment logs

2\. May need to clear Vercel cache

3\. May need to redeploy manually

# üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

## Backend Agent Must Verify:

- [ ] Rewrites added to next.config.mjs  
- [ ] Middleware skipAuthPaths updated  
- [ ] Legacy broken routes removed or fixed  
- [ ] Deployed to Vercel  
- [ ] All test curls return 200 status

---

# ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT DO THESE THINGS

## Backend Agent:

- DO NOT change the working `/_backend/api/*` routes  
- DO NOT modify database schema  
- DO NOT change cookie configuration  
- DO NOT edit .env\* files

# üìä BACKEND AGENT EXECUTION REPORT

**Execution Date:** December 2024  
**Agent:** Backend Claude AI Agent

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### Task 1: Add Rewrite Rules ‚úÖ
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **File Modified:** `next.config.mjs`
- **Changes:** Added rewrites for `/api/credits/balance` and `/api/balance` to point to `/_backend/api/balance`
- **Note:** Did not add rewrites for ask/ask-stream as they already exist in app/api (not in _backend)

### Task 2: Update Middleware Skip Paths ‚úÖ
- **Status:** ALREADY CORRECT
- **File Checked:** `middleware.ts`
- **Result:** All required skip paths were already present in the middleware configuration

### Task 3: Remove Broken Legacy Routes ‚úÖ
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Deleted `app/api/balance/route.ts` - This was the problematic legacy route with complex implementation
  - Kept `app/api/credits/balance/route.ts` - This correctly re-exports from _backend
  - Verified `app/_backend/api/balance/route.ts` is the working implementation

### Task 4: Deploy and Test üîÑ
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Next Steps:** 
  - Committing changes to Git
  - Pushing to GitHub
  - Deploying via Vercel CLI
  - Testing endpoints

## üìù SUMMARY

All backend routing fixes have been implemented:
1. ‚úÖ Rewrite rules added to redirect frontend calls to backend routes
2. ‚úÖ Middleware authentication bypass paths already configured correctly  
3. ‚úÖ Removed conflicting legacy balance route that was causing 500 errors
4. üîÑ Deployment in progress
