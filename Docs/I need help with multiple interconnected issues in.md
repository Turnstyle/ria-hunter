# I need help with multiple interconnected issues in a production semantic search system using Supabase, pgvector, and Vercel. Please provide comprehensive solutions for:

## 1. VECTOR CONVERSION CRISIS

- PostgreSQL `narratives` table has `embedding` and `embedding_vector` columns defined as `vector(768)`
- But data is stored as JSON strings `'[-0.027366478,-0.028...]'` (9500 bytes each) instead of native vectors
- 41,303 rows need conversion without causing timeouts
- `match_narratives` RPC using `<=>` operator times out on string data
- Need batch conversion strategy for Supabase's 2-8 second statement limits


## 2. SEMANTIC SEARCH ARCHITECTURE

- Using Vertex AI text-embedding-005 (768 dims) for query embeddings
- Frontend at ria-hunter.app proxies to backend at ria-hunter.vercel.app via rewrites
- Search falls back to structured SQL when embeddings fail (0% confidence scores)
- Need best practices for:
    * Handling embedding generation failures gracefully
    * Optimal similarity thresholds for financial/RIA domain
    * Whether to use HNSW vs IVFFlat indexes
    * Combining semantic search with structured filters (city, state, AUM)


## 3. VERCEL DEPLOYMENT ISSUES

- Custom domain stuck on old deployment (different x-vercel-id headers)
- API routes return 405 errors on custom domain but work on .vercel.app
- Using proxy rewrites as workaround but need permanent fix
- Edge server caching problems with Anycast IPs


## 4. PERFORMANCE \& SCALING

- How to optimize pgvector for 75,950 total narratives (41,303 with embeddings)
- Best index parameters (m, ef_construction) for HNSW with financial text
- Whether to use embedding_vector OR embedding column (or both?)
- Connection pooling strategies for Supabase with high-concurrency searches
- Caching strategies for embeddings and search results


## 5. PRODUCTION BEST PRACTICES

- Monitoring semantic search quality (confidence scores always 0 currently)
- A/B testing semantic vs structured search
- Handling partial embedding coverage (only 54% of narratives have embeddings)
- Backup strategies for vector data
- Cost optimization for embedding generation APIs


## 6. DEBUGGING \& RECOVERY

- How to diagnose why `match_narratives` returns 0 matches even with valid query embeddings
- Testing vector similarity locally without full infrastructure
- Recovery strategies when embeddings are corrupted
- Rollback procedures for vector column changes
Please provide:
- Step-by-step SQL for safe JSON-to-vector conversion with progress tracking
- Architectural recommendations for semantic search at scale
- Vercel/Next.js best practices for API proxying and CORS
- Performance benchmarks for different pgvector configurations
- Code examples for robust error handling in the full stack
- Migration strategy from current broken state to production-ready system
- Monitoring and observability setup for vector search quality
Context: Production RIA (Registered Investment Advisor) search platform serving financial advisors, using OpenAI/Vertex AI embeddings, Supabase PostgreSQL with pgvector, Next.js on Vercel. System currently failing semantic search due to vector storage issues and falling back to basic SQL filters."
---

Below are concrete, production-ready solutions for each of your interconnected issues leveraging Supabase, pgvector, and Vercel, with detailed technical strategies and practical recommendations for your RIA semantic search system.

***

## VECTOR CONVERSION CRISIS

- **Safe Batch Vector Migration**
    - You can cast your JSON array embedding strings to the `vector` type in PostgreSQL using `::text::vector`, but *must batch updates* to avoid statement timeouts—Supabase’s SQL/RPC limits are 2–8 seconds depending on roles and traffic.[^1][^2]
    - **Step-by-step SQL Example (Progress-tracked)**

1. Add a boolean `embedding_converted` column (or use a temporary column).
2. Use a loop or application batch of 100–500 rows per update:

```sql
-- Add marker column
ALTER TABLE narratives ADD COLUMN embedding_converted boolean DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Batch update (adjust limit/where clause for batching)
UPDATE narratives
SET embedding_vector = embedding::text::vector, embedding_converted = TRUE
WHERE NOT embedding_converted
LIMIT 500;

-- For progress, query:
SELECT count(*) AS remaining FROM narratives WHERE NOT embedding_converted;
```

3. Run this as a periodic script until all rows are converted.[^3]
    - **Avoid Timeouts**
        - Run conversions outside RPC if possible, or via an Edge Function if you need to orchestrate from Vercel/Supabase.[^1]
        - Use transaction control (commit per batch) for safe partial progress and rerun capability.

***

## SEMANTIC SEARCH ARCHITECTURE

- **Handling Embedding Failures**
    - Log both embedding generation errors and search “confidence 0” events; fallback to SQL filters when embedding service (Vertex/OpenAI) fails or times out.
    - Always store the *error reason* (API error, null vector, etc.) for analysis.
    - Consider queuing failed embedding jobs for retry (use Supabase background jobs or logs).
- **Similarity Thresholds**
    - Domain-specific: for financial data, start with cosine similarity thresholds of `0.75–0.85`, but calibrate empirically via relevance judgments.
    - Collect user click data or internal review to refine.
- **Index Type: HNSW vs IVFFlat**
    - **HNSW**: Best for low-latency, high-recall financial text, supports incremental indexing, and is recommended for production unless storage is critical.[^4]
    - **IVFFlat**: Better for bulk, static datasets but needs reindex on new inserts.
    - For your use case, **HNSW** is preferred if your Supabase tier supports it.
- **Combining Search with Filters**
    - Always combine semantic similarity with SQL filtered WHERE (e.g., `city`, `state`, `AUM`) for both semantic and regulatory requirements.
    - This can be done in SQL: filter candidates first, then apply `<=>` semantic operator on the subset.

***

## VERCEL DEPLOYMENT ISSUES

- **405 Errors on Custom Domain**
    - Confirm Next.js `rewrites`/`proxies` correctly match the API path of the custom domain and NOT just the `.vercel.app` domain (route mismatch commonly causes 405).
    - Set `trailingSlash` and `basePath` in `next.config.js` for cross-domain consistency.
    - Clear all Vercel/CDN/Edge caches and re-deploy; compare `x-vercel-id` headers to confirm deployment associations have updated.
    - **API routes**: Use `API` directory for Next.js rather than `pages/api` for lasting compatibility; consider running a custom server if advanced routing is required.
- **Edge Caching/Anycast**
    - For endpoints that must not be cached, explicitly set `Cache-Control: no-store` or use `revalidate` option in Next.js API routes for dynamic results.

***

## PERFORMANCE \& SCALING

- **Optimizing pgvector**
    - Use only one vector column for query and indexing (`embedding_vector`). Store original string/JSON only for auditing or migration rollback.
    - Drop the legacy vector column after validation.
- **Index Parameters for HNSW**
    - For 768D embeddings:
        - `m=16`, `ef_construction=200` for balance of recall and index time.
        - Analyze with `ANALYZE narratives`, test search latency at scale.[^4]
    - Measure recall by sampling semantic queries and correlating semantic scores with human review.
- **Connection Pooling**
    - For high concurrency, use Supabase’s connection pooler (pgBouncer) or an external pool if supported.
    - Set `pool_size` and keep RPC short; offload long vector ops to jobs/Edge Functions.
- **Caching**
    - Embed an LRU or distributed cache (e.g. Redis) for computed embeddings and search responses with known top queries.
    - Cache recent vector search results, especially for common financial keywords.

***

## PRODUCTION BEST PRACTICES

- **Monitoring Semantic Quality**
    - Log all confidence scores and matches. Monitor mean/median confidence and false-negative rates (0 scores).
    - Alert for abnormal drops (e.g., always zero).
- **A/B Testing**
    - Randomly assign users/requests to semantic vs. structured SQL fallback, track engagement or conversions.
- **Partial Coverage**
    - Mark narratives missing embeddings, inform users, and schedule periodic embedding jobs for backfill.
- **Backup**
    - Dump the `narratives` table (especially embedding columns) regularly via `pg_dump` or Supabase backup tools.
- **Cost Optimization**
    - Buffer embedding jobs, batch requests to Vertex/OpenAI to minimize API calls and leverage volume discounts where available.

***

## DEBUGGING \& RECOVERY

- **Diagnosing Zero Matches**
    - If `match_narratives` returns 0, verify that:

1. The vector column is populated and indexed (`embedding_vector is not null` subset).
2. Input query embedding is 768D and normalized.
3. The operator `<=>` is running on the correct column (i.e., not the JSON string).
    - Query a known test embedding for a narrative to confirm the system returns at least a self-match.
- **Local Testing**
    - Spin up a local Postgres with pgvector. Insert a few known narratives and embeddings.
    - Use `SELECT id, embedding_vector <=> '[vector array]'::vector AS sim FROM narratives ORDER BY sim LIMIT 5;` to verify similarity.
- **Recovery and Rollback**
    - If embeddings become corrupt, replace the `embedding_vector` column for affected rows.
    - Retain the JSON string for recovery until fully migrated, then drop legacy columns.

***

## MIGRATION STRATEGY

1. Add marker column for tracking old -> new format conversion.
2. Run progressive, batch-wise JSON string-to-vector conversion.
3. Validate search with sample queries post-migration.
4. Drop deprecated columns, reindex vector column for optimal search.
5. Enable HNSW, set parameters, and benchmark.
6. Lock down slow RPCs to async jobs/Edge Functions.

***

## MONITORING \& OBSERVABILITY

- **Metrics**
    - Log: embedding generation success/failure, semantic match counts, latency, error rates.
    - Track frequency of SQL fallback, confidence score distributions.
- **Tools**
    - Use Supabase’s dashboard and logs, Next.js middleware for tracing requests, and add Sentry or LogRocket for error tracking end-to-end.

**Code Example: Robust Update** (run in batches)

```sql
-- Example: Update 500 batches per execution
UPDATE narratives
SET embedding_vector = embedding::text::vector, embedding_converted = TRUE
WHERE NOT embedding_converted
LIMIT 500;
```

**Frontend/Backend Error Handling Example**

```js
try {
  const resp = await fetchEmbedding(text); // to Vertex/OpenAI
  if (!resp.success) throw new Error('Embedding failed');
  // Proceed to vector search
} catch (err) {
  // Log error, fallback to SQL search, notify user gracefully
  useStructuredSearch(query);
}
```

**Monitor Semantic Quality**

```sql
SELECT AVG(confidence_score), COUNT(*) FROM search_logs WHERE search_type = 'semantic';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM narratives WHERE embedding_vector IS NULL;
```
