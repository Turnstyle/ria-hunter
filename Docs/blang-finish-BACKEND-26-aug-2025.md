## **üîß PROMPT FOR *BACKEND* AGENT (paste this verbatim to the backend agent)**

**Objective:**  
 Make the production endpoints behind `https://ria-hunter.app/_backend/api/...` reliable for both **anonymous** and **signed‚Äëin** users, ensure subscription status is persisted and exposed, and make the chat streaming endpoint finish cleanly. Add smoke tests and minimal unit tests.

---

### **0\) Repo discovery (don‚Äôt skip)**

1. Search the repo for the **actual implementation file** that serves **`/_backend/api/credits/balance`** in production. Use the Next.js route manifest (or your framework‚Äôs router) to locate it; do **not** create a new route at a guessed path. Open it.

2. Do the same for **`/_backend/api/stripe-webhook`** and for the **chat/inference streaming route** that the UI calls (the one producing the long unformatted text and spinner). Open each file.

From screenshots and logs we know these production URLs are real. Find the source files that back them.

---

### **1\) Credits Balance API must never 401 for anonymous users**

**Current bug:** frontend calls `/_backend/api/credits/balance` while unsigned, receives **401**, then the header shows no ‚Äú15 free credits‚Äù.

**Fix (in the real balance route you found):**

* Convert the route to **allow anonymous**:

  * Read session from cookies (Supabase or whatever you use). If **no session**, **do not** throw 401\.

  * Ensure there is a stable **guest id**:

    * If no signed‚Äëin user and no `guest_id` cookie exists, create one (`uuid v4`), set `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` (on prod), `Max‚ÄëAge: 30d`.

* Compute result:

  * If **signed‚Äëin**:

    * Ensure there‚Äôs a `user_accounts` row for the user (create if missing).

    * Determine `isSubscriber` from your table fields updated by the webhook (`subscription_status = 'active'` or `is_pro = true`).

    * Resolve `credits` from your balance logic (DB view/function if present) **or** fall back to `0` if Pro.

  * If **anonymous**:

    * Return `{ credits: 15, isSubscriber: false, source: 'guest-default' }`. Do **not** hit the database for a guest unless you already persist guest balances.

**Return shape** (standardize):

 { "credits": \<number\>, "isSubscriber": \<boolean\> }

*  (Optionally include `"source"` during `?debug=1`.)

* **HTTP details:** `200 OK`, `Cache-Control: no-store`, content-type `application/json`.

**Tiny unit test to add (Vitest or Jest‚Äîuse whatever the repo already uses):**

* Create `tests/credits/optionalUser.test.ts` that imports your `getOptionalUser` (or equivalent) and asserts:

  * When cookies are empty ‚áí returns `null` and **does not throw**.

  * When cookies contain `guest_id` only ‚áí still returns `null`.

  * When cookies have a valid auth session ‚áí returns a user object.

* Add `tests/credits/shape.test.ts` that calls the handler through a mocked request **without** a session and asserts `status 200` and JSON has both keys `credits` and `isSubscriber`.

**Curl smoke test file** (add to repo as `scripts/smoke.sh` and make it executable):

\#\!/usr/bin/env bash

set \-euo pipefail

APP\_URL="${APP\_URL:-https://ria-hunter.app}"

echo "1) Anonymous credits/balance should be 200 and include credits=15"

curl \-sS \-i "$APP\_URL/\_backend/api/credits/balance" | tee /tmp/credits\_anon.headers | sed \-n '1,15p'

curl \-sS "$APP\_URL/\_backend/api/credits/balance" | jq .

echo "2) Stripe webhook health (GET handler must exist and return 200)"

\# Implement a GET ping in the webhook route (see section 2\) to avoid needing a Stripe signature for smoke.

curl \-sS \-i "$APP\_URL/\_backend/api/stripe-webhook?ping=1" | sed \-n '1,10p'

echo "3) Chat route: HEAD must be 200 (no body). Replace PATH with your real route path if different."

curl \-sS \-I "$APP\_URL/\_backend/api/chat" | sed \-n '1,10p' || true

Add a package.json script:

"scripts": {

  "smoke": "bash scripts/smoke.sh"

}

---

### **2\) Webhook route: keep the 200s coming and add a simple GET health check**

You‚Äôve already fixed the delivery (200). Finish hardening:

* **POST** (Stripe):

  * Continue verifying the signature against the **raw body**.

  * On `customer.subscription.updated`:

    * Extract `subscription.id`, `status`, `customer`, and **`metadata.user_id`** (present in your event sample).

    * **Upsert** into `public.user_accounts` keyed by that internal `user_id`:

      * `stripe_customer_id`

      * `stripe_subscription_id`

      * `subscription_status`

      * `is_pro = (status in ['active','trialing'])`

      * `updated_at = now()`

  * Make the handler **idempotent** (no duplicate rows, no double crediting).

  * Return `{ ok: true }`.

* **GET** (health):

  * Implement a **lightweight GET** handler that returns 200 JSON `{ ok: true }` when `?ping=1` is present.

  * This lets us verify routing without a Stripe signature and is used by the smoke test above.

* **Logging (only on `?debug=1`)**: include a short JSON object with `event.id`, `type`, and any DB updates.

---

### **3\) Streaming/chat endpoint: finish the stream and guarantee natural‚Äëlanguage output**

Symptoms: the page shows a long unformatted blob and the spinner keeps spinning (the stream never signals completion or the model wasn‚Äôt called).

**Implement these in the actual streaming route you found:**

* Ensure **LLM is always attempted** when we have a prompt. If you detect missing provider keys (OpenAI/Gemini), log a **single** server warning and return a **clear English** fallback like:

   ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt reach the model right now. Here‚Äôs the raw context I found: ‚Ä¶‚Äù

* **SSE protocol**:

  * Set headers:  
     `Content-Type: text/event-stream`  
     `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform`  
     `Connection: keep-alive`

  * For each token, write exactly `data: {"token":"..."}\n\n` (or `data: <raw>\n\n` if plain text).

  * On completion, write **`data: [DONE]\n\n`**, then **flush and close** the stream.  
     (Your frontend already knows `[DONE]`; just make sure you actually send it in all code paths.)

* When falling back to raw context (no LLM), still stream it as user‚Äëfriendly English (e.g., ‚ÄúBased on two firms, here‚Äôs a plain summary: ‚Ä¶‚Äù) and then `[DONE]`.

**Tiny unit test:** factor a small `formatSSEToken(token)` helper and test it produces the two newlines and escapes properly.

---

### **4\) Expose subscription status via balance (no extra roundtrip)**

Return `isSubscriber` in **every** credits/balance response:

* Signed‚Äëin \+ Pro ‚áí `isSubscriber: true, credits: 0` (or ignore credits for Pro‚Äîyour UI uses the flag).

* Anonymous ‚áí `isSubscriber: false, credits: 15`.

---

### **5\) Env and configuration checks (fail early, not at runtime)**

* If required env keys are missing for your chosen LLM provider, **log once** on boot and let the chat route return the friendly fallback above.

* Keep the Stripe signing secret pulled from env and compare to the dashboard value you already set.

---

### **6\) Deliverables checklist (what you must commit)**

1. Modified **real** balance route (no 401s for anonymous).

2. Modified **real** webhook route (POST verified & idempotent, GET `?ping=1`).

3. Modified **real** chat streaming route (always `[DONE]`, English fallback).

4. `scripts/smoke.sh` \+ `"smoke"` npm script.

5. Tiny tests under `tests/credits/‚Ä¶` and (optionally) `tests/stream/‚Ä¶`.

**Run locally (or against prod):**

APP\_URL=https://ria-hunter.app pnpm smoke

pnpm test

**Acceptance (must all pass):**

* `curl https://ria-hunter.app/_backend/api/credits/balance` returns **200**, JSON includes `credits` and `isSubscriber`. When not signed in it shows `credits: 15, isSubscriber: false`.

* Stripe dashboard **resend** of `customer.subscription.updated` continues to show **200**.

* A simple chat query yields natural English and the spinner stops (stream ends with `[DONE]`).

If the agent hits something it can‚Äôt locate (e.g., can‚Äôt find the real file that maps to a production path), it should **search the repo‚Äôs route manifest and codebase** until it finds it rather than inventing a new path.
