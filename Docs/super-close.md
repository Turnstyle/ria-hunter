# Super Close - 25 Aug 2025

This document tracks the implementation of back-end features for RIA Hunter, focusing on Stripe webhook reliability, subscriber status persistence in Supabase, and standardizing the balance API.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Created minimal Supabase schema**
   - Created migration file `supabase/migrations/2025-08-25_credits_and_accounts.sql` with:
     - `user_accounts` table: Stores user information with Stripe linkage and pro flag
     - `credit_transactions` table: Tracks credit transactions for non-subscribers
     - `stripe_events` table: Ensures webhook idempotency
     - Functions and triggers for managing the schema

2. **Updated Stripe webhook handler**
   - Implemented in `app/_backend/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts`
   - Properly verifies Stripe signature with raw body
   - Handles subscription events (created, updated, deleted)
   - Upserts user data into `user_accounts` based on email
   - Sets `is_pro` flag based on subscription status
   - Implements idempotency using `stripe_events` table

3. **Hardened the balance endpoint**
   - Updated `app/_backend/api/balance/route.ts` to return standardized response format
   - Always returns `{ credits, balance, isSubscriber, source }` structure
   - Returns `{ credits: null, balance: null, isSubscriber: true }` for subscribers
   - Gracefully handles missing tables with cookie fallback
   - Uses Supabase auth to identify the user by email

4. **Added debug endpoints**
   - Created `app/_backend/api/billing/debug/route.ts` to show system status
   - Created `app/_backend/api/admin/db-sanity/route.ts` for database bootstrapping
   - Both secured with `Authorization: Bearer ${CREDITS_SECRET}` header
   - Debug endpoint shows table existence and sample user data
   - DB sanity endpoint creates required tables if they don't exist

5. **Kept legacy alias routes**
   - Verified that `/api/stripe-webhook` forwards to `/_backend/api/stripe-webhook`
   - Updated `/api/credits/balance` to use the new standardized balance endpoint

6. **Implemented Stripe Billing Portal**
   - Created `app/_backend/api/stripe/portal/route.ts`
   - Finds or creates Stripe customer for authenticated user
   - Generates and returns a Stripe Billing Portal session URL

7. **Created documentation**
   - Created `docs/STRIPE_DB_WIRING.md` explaining the schema and integration
   - Documented the table shapes
   - Explained how webhook maps Stripe status to `is_pro` flag
   - Added instructions for using debug endpoints
   - Included acceptance checks for verifying implementation

## Issues and Potential Improvements

1. **Error Handling**
   - Added basic error handling but could be enhanced with more detailed logging

2. **Testing Coverage**
   - No automated tests were implemented for these changes
   - Should add unit tests for webhook handler and balance endpoint

3. **Database Migration**
   - The migration file is set up but needs to be run manually or via the db-sanity endpoint
   - Could benefit from an automated migration process during deployment

4. **Webhook Event Types**
   - Currently only handles basic subscription events
   - Could expand to handle invoice and payment-related events

5. **Credits System Integration**
   - Current implementation focuses on pro subscribers with unlimited usage
   - Credit transaction system exists but isn't fully integrated with Stripe purchases

6. **Balance Endpoint Performance**
   - The balance endpoint makes multiple database queries
   - Could be optimized with a single query or stored procedure

## Next Steps

1. Run the DB sanity endpoint to create required tables: 
   ```
   POST /_backend/api/admin/db-sanity
   Authorization: Bearer ${CREDITS_SECRET}
   ```

2. Verify the implementation with the acceptance checks in `docs/STRIPE_DB_WIRING.md`

3. Monitor error logs after deployment to catch any issues in production
