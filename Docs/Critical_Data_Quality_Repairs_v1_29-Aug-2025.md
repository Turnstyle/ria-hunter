# Critical Data Quality Repairs v1 - August 29, 2025

## üéØ Executive Summary

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The narrative generation process created ~15,295 corrupted embeddings due to missing RIA names, requiring complete regeneration of embeddings for proper RAG functionality.

**IMPACT**: Poor semantic search quality, generic results instead of meaningful firm descriptions, wasted API costs.

**SOLUTION**: Fix RIA names first, then regenerate all affected embeddings with quality gates.

## üö® Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing RIA Names
- **When**: Narrative generation ran August 21, 2025 (1:39-2:21 AM)
- **Problem**: 15,295 RIA profiles had missing/null legal_name fields
- **Result**: AI generated generic narratives like "Investment Adviser (CRD #12345)..."
- **Impact**: Corrupted embeddings with poor semantic value

### Secondary Issues
1. **ETL Process**: Didn't prioritize alternative name fields from SEC data
2. **No Quality Gates**: No validation to skip records with missing names
3. **Batch Processing**: All 41,303 generated without quality checks
4. **Timing**: Ran before name cleanup was completed

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### Name Prioritization Algorithm
```
1. dba_name (Doing Business As - what clients search for)
2. primary_business_name  
3. business_name
4. adviser_name
5. organization_name
6. firm_name
7. entity_name
8. sec_filing_name
9. registrant_name
10. company_name
11. legal_name (original field)
12. Default: "Unknown Investment Adviser (CRD #XXXXX)"
```

### Quality Gates for Narrative Generation
- Skip records with null/empty legal_name AND firm_name
- Validate narrative doesn't contain generic patterns
- Ensure narrative has specific firm details (name, location, services)
- Log skipped records for manual review

### Batch Processing Configuration
- **Batch Size**: 50-100 narratives per API call
- **Delay**: 1-2 seconds between batches to avoid rate limits
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Progress Tracking**: Log every 100 processed records
