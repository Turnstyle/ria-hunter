# Hardening for Master AI Agent - 25th August 2025

## Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation of the Stripe subscription integration hardening tasks requested by the Master AI Agent. All requested tasks have been completed.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Stripe Webhook Handler Enhancement

The webhook handler (`app/_backend/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts`) has been enhanced to:

- Process additional event types:
  - `checkout.session.completed` - now properly handled by retrieving the associated subscription
  - `customer.subscription.created` - previously implemented
  - `customer.subscription.updated` - previously implemented
  - `customer.subscription.deleted` - previously implemented, enhanced to set `is_pro=false`

- Implement multiple user resolution paths in priority order:
  1. First, check `subscription.metadata.user_id` if present
  2. If not found, look up user by `stripe_customer_id`
  3. If still not found, retrieve customer from Stripe API to get email, then look up by email

- Store full event payload in the `stripe_events` table for better debugging and auditing
  - Added a `payload JSONB` column to the `stripe_events` table
  - Full event object is now stored along with the event ID and type

- Improved error handling and logging:
  - Enhanced logging to track which resolution path was used
  - Added detailed error logging with appropriate context
  - Maintained 200 OK responses for processed webhooks (even errors) to prevent Stripe retries

### 2. Balance Endpoint Upgrade

The balance endpoint (`app/_backend/api/balance/route.ts`) now:

- Tries to use `public_get_credits_balance` function first as specified in requirements
- Falls back to `get_credits_balance` if the public function is not available
- Ensures the response format always includes:
  ```json
  {
    "credits": number | null,
    "isSubscriber": boolean,
    "balance": number | null
  }
  ```
- Maintains fallback to cookie-based credits when database functions are unavailable
- Properly handles subscribers by returning `isSubscriber: true` and `credits: null`

### 3. Developer Backfill Utility

Added a new utility endpoint at `app/_backend/api/dev/backfill-user-account/route.ts` that:

- Creates/updates a `user_accounts` record for an existing auth user
- Only works in development/preview environments for security
- Takes an email parameter and links it to the correct auth user
- Returns detailed information about the created/existing account

### 4. Database Schema Updates

- Added migration file to update the `stripe_events` table schema with a `payload JSONB` column
- Ensured compatibility with existing data and operations

## Verification Steps

To verify the implementation is working correctly:

1. **Verify Webhook Processing:**
   
   Resend events from the Stripe dashboard and check database records:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, is_pro, subscription_status, stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id
   FROM public.user_accounts
   ORDER BY updated_at DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   Also verify webhook events are properly recorded:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, type, created_at
   FROM public.stripe_events
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

2. **Check Balance Endpoint:**

   When logged in as a subscriber, the endpoint should return:
   ```json
   {
     "credits": null,
     "balance": null,
     "isSubscriber": true,
     "source": "db"
   }
   ```

   For a non-subscriber with credits:
   ```json
   {
     "credits": 15,
     "balance": 15,
     "isSubscriber": false,
     "source": "db"
   }
   ```

3. **Test Developer Backfill:**

   In development/preview environments:
   ```
   GET /_backend/api/dev/backfill-user-account?email=user@example.com
   ```

   Should create a new user_accounts record if one doesn't exist.

## Potential Issues and Future Improvements

1. **Webhook Signature Verification**
   - Currently implemented but depends on raw body access being configured correctly in Next.js

2. **Function Availability**
   - The implementation handles gracefully if `public_get_credits_balance` doesn't exist
   - A fallback to `get_credits_balance` is in place

3. **Error Handling**
   - Webhook errors are logged but always return 200 OK to Stripe (as required)
   - Consider adding monitoring/alerting for repeated errors

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - The balance endpoint maintains backward compatibility by including both `credits` and `balance` fields

## Conclusion

All required hardening tasks for the Stripe integration have been completed. The implementation follows best practices for idempotency, error handling, and user account management. The system should now correctly handle Stripe subscription events, maintain accurate user account data, and provide proper credit balance information to authenticated users.
