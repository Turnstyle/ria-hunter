I need detailed guidance on setting up Google Cloud Vertex AI embeddings authentication in a Vercel production environment for a Next.js application. Here's my specific setup:
**Tech Stack:**

- Next.js app deployed on Vercel
- Using Google Cloud Vertex AI for text embeddings (768-dimension vectors)
- PostgreSQL database with pgvector for semantic search
- Node.js backend API routes
**Current Setup:**
- Google Cloud Project: "ria-hunter-backend"
- Service Account: "doc-ai-service-account" with roles: AI Platform Developer, Document AI Editor, Vertex AI User, Service Account Token Creator
- Vercel environment variables: GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_B64
**Issues:**
- Embeddings generation works locally but fails in Vercel production
- API calls to Vertex AI return authentication errors in production
- Local development uses service account key file, production needs different approach
**Please provide:**

1. Best practices for Google Cloud authentication in Vercel serverless functions
2. Proper environment variable setup (JSON vs B64 vs other methods)
3. Code examples for initializing Vertex AI client in serverless environment
4. Common authentication pitfalls with Vercel + Google Cloud
5. How to properly handle service account keys in production
6. Debugging steps for authentication failures
7. Alternative authentication methods (ADC, Workload Identity, etc.)
8. Specific considerations for Vertex AI Text Embedding API authentication
Include code snippets and step-by-step configuration instructions for a production-ready setup.
```

Setting up **Google Cloud Vertex AI embeddings** authentication in a Vercel production environment for a Next.js app requires careful handling of service account credentials due to Vercel's serverless constraints. Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step guide tailored to your tech stack and requirements.

## Google Cloud Authentication Best Practices (Vercel)

- Vercel serverless functions cannot mount files, so the best practice is to pass the **service account key as a base64-encoded environment variable** instead of a file path.
- Avoid long-lived service account keys if possible, but direct key use is currently required for serverless platforms like Vercel.[^1]
- Grant the least privilege necessary to the service account, following the principle of least privilege for production deployments.[^2]

## Environment Variable Setup (Base64 vs JSON)

- **DO NOT** upload raw JSON as a variable due to encoding and multiline issues.
- **Convert your service account JSON** to base64 and use that as an environment variable (e.g. `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`).[^3][^4][^1]
- For decoding in runtime:
  ```js
  const encoded = process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY;
  const credentials = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(encoded, "base64").toString("utf-8"));
```

- Do not set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to a path; pass credentials as an object.[^5][^1]


## Code Example: Vertex AI Client Initialization

For a serverless Next.js API route:

```javascript
// /pages/api/embed.js or /app/api/embed/route.js
import { PredictionServiceClient } from '@google-cloud/aiplatform';
const { Buffer } = require('buffer');

// Decode the service account key from base64 environment variable
const credentials = JSON.parse(
  Buffer.from(process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY, 'base64').toString('utf-8')
);

const client = new PredictionServiceClient({
  projectId: credentials.project_id,
  credentials: {
    client_email: credentials.client_email,
    private_key: credentials.private_key
  }
});
// Use client to call Vertex AI embeddings API...
```

- Always instantiate the client inside the handler to avoid leaking secrets across invocations.[^4][^5][^3]


## Common Authentication Pitfalls on Vercel + Google Cloud

- Not decoding base64 properly before using credentials leads to malformed credentials JSON or authentication errors.[^3]
- Setting `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to a path (no access in serverless) will cause the SDK to fail.
- Wrong project, wrong roles, or outdated key versions can result in permission denied.
- Failing to add the variable to the proper Vercel environment scope (production, preview, development).[^6]


## Handling Service Account Keys Securely

- Restrict key download and rotate keys regularly.
- Only give service account the minimum required permissions (see your current setup).[^2]
- Monitor use of Vercel environment variables for accidental exposure.
- Do not commit any key to source control.


## Debugging Authentication Failures

- Ensure Vercel environment variable is set in the correct scope and re-deploy to sync changes.
- Add serverless logs to print the decoded credentials and error stacks (without printing sensitive fields in production).
- Use `gcloud` to test service account permissions.
- Check Vertex AI IAM permissions for the service account.
- Use Google Cloud audit logs for API errors.[^6]


## Alternative Authentication Methods

- **Application Default Credentials (ADC):** Only works if GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is a file path; not usable on Vercel.[^7][^1]
- **Workload Identity Federation:** Not generally supported or straightforward on Vercel as of now.[^8][^1]
- **Service Account Impersonation:** Not natively supported on Vercel; intended for GCP-hosted environments.


## Vertex AI Text Embedding API Authentication Caveats

- Vertex AI always requires OAuth 2.0/signing via service account or other identity. API key-based auth is not supported for embeddings.
- Ensure correct region and endpoint when instantiating the client.
- Make sure the service account has roles: Vertex AI User, AI Platform Developer, and Service Account Token Creator.[^9][^7][^2]

## Summary Table: Auth Approaches on Vercel

| Authentication Method | Supported on Vercel | Secure | Complexity | Notes |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :-- |
| Service Account Key (B64) | Yes | Moderate | Low | Most common for serverless[^1][^3] |
| GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS (file) | No | N/A | N/A | Cannot mount files in Vercel |
| ADC via Workload Identity | No | High | High | GCP-hosted only/won't work[^1][^8] |
