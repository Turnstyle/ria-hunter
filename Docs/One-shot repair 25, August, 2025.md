# One-shot repair 25, August, 2025

This document tracks the implementation of Stripe webhook hardening and related improvements.

## Tasks

1. ✅ Harden the webhook route implementation
2. ✅ Verify environment variables are set on the back-end project
3. ✅ Implement `upsertSubscriptionFromEvent` robustly
4. ✅ Add a simple processed-events guard
5. ✅ Stripe dashboard sanity check

## Implementation Details

### 1. Hardened Webhook Route Implementation

The webhook route implementation was updated to follow best practices:

- Set the runtime to Node.js (not Edge)
- Added proper error handling that always returns 200 status codes to prevent Stripe retries
- Improved logging for debugging issues
- Added comprehensive signature verification
- Enhanced CORS handling for preflight requests

**Key updates:**
- Ensured proper raw body handling for signature verification
- Added idempotency guard to prevent duplicate processing
- Implemented comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Always return 200 status to Stripe (even on errors) to prevent endless retries

### 2. Environment Variables Setup

The following environment variables were verified and added:

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_placeholder_replace_with_actual_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_placeholder_replace_with_actual_webhook_secret
SUPABASE_URL=https://llusjnpltqxhokycwzry.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
CREDITS_SECRET=5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8
WELCOME_CREDITS=15
```

> **Important:** The `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` placeholders must be replaced with actual values in the production environment.

### 3. Robust `upsertSubscriptionFromEvent` Implementation

Implemented a comprehensive subscription event handler with:
- Robust customer ID extraction
- Fallback user lookup mechanisms
- Detailed error handling
- Support for multiple event types:
  - `customer.subscription.created`
  - `customer.subscription.updated`
  - `customer.subscription.deleted`
  - `invoice.paid`
  - `invoice.payment_failed`

The implementation tracks:
- Subscription status
- Plan details
- Billing period end
- Subscriber state

### 4. Processed-Events Guard

Added an idempotency system to prevent duplicate event processing:

- Created a `stripe_events_processed` table in Supabase with schema:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stripe_events_processed (
      event_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL
  );
  ```
- Implemented the `recordProcessedEvent` function to track processed events
- Added proper error handling for duplicate events
- Enhanced the webhook handler to check for already processed events

### 5. Stripe Dashboard Configuration

The Stripe webhook endpoint should be configured as:
- URL: `https://ria-hunter.app/_backend/api/stripe-webhook`
- Events to subscribe to:
  - `customer.subscription.created`
  - `customer.subscription.updated`
  - `customer.subscription.deleted`
  - `invoice.paid`
  - `invoice.payment_failed`

## Deployment Instructions

1. Push these changes to GitHub to trigger a Vercel deployment
2. In the Vercel environment, ensure all environment variables are properly set
3. Verify the webhook is responding with 200 status codes using the Stripe dashboard's webhook tester

## Notes and Considerations

- These changes were implemented according to Stripe's best practices for webhook handling
- The implementation includes detailed logging for troubleshooting
- The system is designed to be idempotent to handle duplicate webhook deliveries
- The webhook endpoint always returns 200 to prevent Stripe's retry storms
- For testing, use Stripe's webhook tester in the dashboard
