# URGENT: Backend Fix for Location Filtering Bug

## Status: ðŸ”§ FIX READY TO DEPLOY

**Date**: February 9, 2025  
**Issue**: Location-based queries returning wrong results  
**Root Cause**: Database functions filtering AFTER search instead of DURING

---

## The Problem

Query: **"10 largest RIAs in St. Louis"**  
Expected: St. Louis, MO results  
Actual: San Francisco, London, etc.

### Root Cause Identified
The `hybrid_search_rias` RPC function had a critical design flaw:
1. Semantic search gets top 60 results globally (no location filter)
2. Text search gets top 60 results globally (no location filter)  
3. Combines them
4. THEN applies Missouri filter â†’ If top 60 are all from California, you get ZERO Missouri results!

---

## The Solution

**Apply location filters DURING the search, not AFTER.**

### Migration Ready
File: `supabase/migrations/20250209_fix_location_filtering_properly.sql`

This migration:
- âœ… Fixes `hybrid_search_rias` to filter by state during semantic search
- âœ… Fixes `search_rias` to filter by state during vector search
- âœ… Ensures location queries return location-specific results

---

## Deployment Instructions [[memory:6637617]]

### Step 1: Apply the Migration

1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/llusjnpltqxhokycwzry/sql

2. Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Copy the entire contents of:
-- supabase/migrations/20250209_fix_location_filtering_properly.sql
```

3. Click **"Run"** to execute

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

Run this test query in the SQL editor:

```sql
-- Test St. Louis query
SELECT * FROM hybrid_search_rias(
    'largest investment advisors',
    (SELECT embedding_proper FROM narratives WHERE embedding_proper IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1),
    0.3,  -- threshold
    10,   -- count
    'MO', -- state filter
    0,    -- min_vc
    0     -- min_aum
);
```

Should return Missouri RIAs including:
- STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY ($54B AUM)
- EDWARD JONES ($5B AUM)

---

## Expected Results After Fix

```javascript
// Query: "10 largest RIAs in St. Louis"
{
  results: [
    {
      legal_name: "STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY",
      city: "ST LOUIS",
      state: "MO",
      aum: 54000000000
    },
    {
      legal_name: "EDWARD JONES",
      city: "ST. LOUIS", 
      state: "MO",
      aum: 5086856000
    }
    // ... more St. Louis results
  ]
}
```

## Timeline
- **Issue discovered**: 5+ minute hang on location queries
- **Root cause found**: RPC functions filtering incorrectly
- **Fix created**: Ready to deploy
- **Deployment time**: < 1 minute

**No frontend changes needed!** The `/api/ask` endpoint will work correctly once this database fix is applied.
