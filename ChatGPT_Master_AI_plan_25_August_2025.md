# ChatGPT Master AI Plan - 25 August 2025

## Project: Ria Hunter - Back-end Refactoring

### Goal
Make Stripe webhooks reliable in production, correctly mark subscribers in the DB, and standardize the balance API for front-end consistency.

### Tasks
1. ✅ Confirm environment & assumptions
2. ✅ Ensure Stripe webhook route uses Node runtime and raw body
3. ✅ Provide thin alias at `/api/stripe-webhook`
4. ✅ Harden the balance endpoint for front-end compatibility
5. ✅ Keep the debug route minimal & safe
6. ✅ Deploy & verify
7. ✅ Add guardrails

### Progress
- Created billing.ts library to encapsulate Stripe database operations
- Updated Stripe webhook route to use Node runtime and properly verify signatures
- Added boot-time logging to verify environment variables
- Created thin alias at /api/stripe-webhook for backward compatibility
- Standardized balance endpoint response to always include balance, credits, and isSubscriber
- Improved error handling and fallbacks in the balance endpoint
- Updated debug route to be minimal and secure
- Added guardrails to ensure webhook failures never result in non-200 responses to Stripe
- Created documentation for Stripe integration setup and verification
- All code modifications pass linting checks
- Pushed changes to GitHub to trigger Vercel deployment

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Stripe Webhook Route
- Implemented in `app/_backend/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts`
- Uses Node runtime with raw body for signature verification
- Logs environment checks at boot time
- Handles customer.subscription events and checkout.session.completed
- Always returns 200 OK to Stripe, even on internal errors

#### 2. Billing Library
- Created `lib/billing.ts` to encapsulate database operations
- Implemented customer-to-user linking strategy
- Added subscription status handling that sets is_subscriber field

#### 3. Balance Endpoint
- Standardized response format: `{ balance, credits, isSubscriber, source }`
- Maintained cookie fallback mechanism for anonymous users
- Added proper error handling to always return valid response

#### 4. Debug Route
- Protected via Authorization header with CREDITS_SECRET
- Returns minimal information about the environment without exposing secrets

### Final Summary

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements:
- Stripe webhooks run on Node runtime (not Edge)
- Webhook signature verification uses raw body text
- Webhooks always return 200 to Stripe to prevent retries
- Balance API standardized with consistent format
- Anonymous user cookie fallback (15 credits) maintained
- Clean Vercel logs for diagnostics
- Documentation added with environment variables and verification steps

No issues or bugs were encountered during implementation. All code passed linting checks and the implementation follows best practices for Stripe webhook handling.

## Vector Migration Implementation (Phase 1 - Completed)

### Overview
Successfully migrated the RIA Hunter database from JSON string embeddings to native PostgreSQL vector(768) format for improved semantic search performance.

### Achievements
- ✅ **Converted 41,303 narratives** from JSON string embeddings to native PostgreSQL vector(768) format
- ✅ **Created vector search functions**:
  - `match_narratives`: For direct vector similarity searches
  - `search_rias_vector`: For enhanced searches with company information
- ✅ Used correct **768-dimensional vectors** (not 384 as originally thought)
- ✅ Successfully performed the conversion in batches through the Supabase SQL Editor
- ✅ Created SQL functions utilizing PostgreSQL's vector operators (<=> for cosine similarity)

### Key SQL Files Preserved
- `COMPLETE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SETUP.sql` - Final setup script for semantic search
- `ULTIMATE_DIRECT_SQL_FIX.sql` - Efficient batch conversion script

### Outstanding Items
- **HNSW Index Creation**: Needs to be done through direct database access or management tools (exceeded SQL Editor limits). This index will enable the target 507x performance improvement.
- **IVFFlat Indexes**: Additional supporting indexes for filtered searches also need to be created through admin tools.

### Performance Expectations
Once the HNSW index is created, vector search performance should improve from ~1800ms to <10ms per query, achieving the target 507x performance improvement specified in the refactor plan.

### Migration Notes
- The SQL Editor in Supabase has transaction timeout limitations for long-running operations
- HNSW index creation for large vector data requires direct database access
- Standard B-tree indexes have size limitations (2704 bytes) that prevent direct indexing of 768-dimensional vectors (3088 bytes)
- Converted string embeddings to vectors using a custom SQL function
- Processed in small batches (5,000 records at a time) to avoid timeouts
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API functions

---

## Next Phases (Pending)

### Phase 2: ETL Pipeline
- Processing the ~62,317 missing narratives 
- Processing missing private funds data (99.99% unprocessed)
- Processing missing control persons data (99.56% unprocessed)

### Key Scripts for Future Data Processing
The following scripts have been preserved for future raw data processing:
- `analyze_raw_ria_data.js` - Initial data analysis (currently empty, needs implementation)
- `clear_and_start_embeddings.js` - Prepares database for fresh embedding generation
- `migrate_to_vector_embeddings.js` - Converts string embeddings to vector format
- `run_batch_conversion.js` - Batch conversion of embeddings
- `super_fast_converter.js` - Optimized parallel conversion script
- `create_hnsw_index.js` - Creates HNSW index for vector search
- Scripts in `/scripts/` directory for narrative generation and embedding creation

### Phases 3-7 (Future Work)
- API standardization
- Infrastructure and monitoring
- Scheduled jobs and automation
- Security and compliance
- Performance testing and validation
